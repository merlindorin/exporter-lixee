# Exporter for Lixee

Exporter for Lixee is a Prometheus exporter designed to help monitor your Lixee setup by exporting
relevant metrics to Prometheus.

## Integrate with Grafana

To integrate the metrics from Prometheus into Grafana, ensure the Prometheus is added as a Datasource. Next you can import the example dashboard from`./grafana`
